This repository contains an implementation of the Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) algorithm 
for training a hard margin Support Vector Machine (SVM). 
The algorithm is used for binary classification tasks where the data is linearly separable,
and the goal is to find a hyperplane that maximizes the margin between two classes.
